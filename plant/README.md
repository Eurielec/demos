# Plant

## Requirements
This demo requires your laptop to have Bluetooth.

## Permissions
Because this demo uses BLE, it needs root to access it. That is why the install takes place on root.

## Install
1. Install python3 and pip3 by `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`.
2. Install dependencies with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Fill the `.env` with your values. Ask for them around at Eurielec.
4. Run by `sudo python3 main.py`.
